* Create a console application that is a text-to-morse-code converter
* See the (Morse Code chart)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code] on Wikipedia
* Ignore all non-alphanumeric characters
* Use ‘.' for dot and ‘-’ for dash and a space between each character
* Sample interaction
```
Enter your text to convert to Morse code
This is a test
Your Morse code is:
- .... .. ... ....... .. ... ....... .- ....... - . ... -
```
* Challenge: Offer the user a menu to select either 1) Text-to-Morse or 2) Morse-to-text and also implement conversions from Morse code to text
