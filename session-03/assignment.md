* Write a console application that plays a simple number guessing game
* The game should pick a random number between 1 and 10
* It should then repeatedly prompt the user to guess the number until it is successfully guessed, outputting whether the guess was “too high” or “too low” for wrong guesses

Sample interaction
`Guess the number between 1 and 10
5
Too high
3
Too low
4
You win!`

* Challenge 1: Prompt the user to input the maximum number they want to guess between 1 and X
* Challenge 2: Validate all user input is a valid integer and falls between 1 and X
