* Use a NASA API to do something cool or useful

  https://api.nasa.gov/index.html
 
* Create a console application that is a public library management system which stores books, patrons, and loans in a database and does all the basic functions of a library – check-in, check-out, late notices/fees, waitlists/holds, etc.
 
* Create a graph (bar, line, pie, etc) programmatically using the Graphics namespace and base it on data form census API, caching the results in a database if they’ve already been retrieved recently
