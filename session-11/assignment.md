* Create (or update) your console to-do list application from assignment 8 that stores its to do item and their statuses in a SQL Server LocalDB database using EF6 instead of ADO.NET
* Allow the user to view their to-do list, add items, remove items, and mark items complete
* Challenge 1: Create you console as a CLI instead of menu-based. ex:

```
todo help
todo add "item 1"
todo complete "item 1"
todo list
etcâ€¦
```

* Challenge 2: Allow the user to view completed items and mark then as incomplete
