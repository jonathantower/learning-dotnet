* Implement the famous “Conway’s game of life” as a C# console application
* Choose a board size 80x25 or smaller
* Rules:
  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
  1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
  1. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
  1. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
