* Create a console to-do list application that stores its items and their statuses in a SQL Server LocalDB database
* Allow the user to view their to-do list, add items, remove items, and mark items complete

* Challenge 1: Create you console as a CLI instead of menu-based. (ex: 
```
todo help
todo add "item 1"
todo complete "item 1"
todo list
```
etc.)

* Challenge 2: Allow the user to view completed items and mark then as incomplete
